# bookmarkApp

This was a solo project by myself to implement recents skills I have learned, including 
Javascript, Jquery, AJAX & Json in conjuction with utilizing an API. Basic styling was applied.

Users should be able to create a new bookmark, filter bookmarks by rating, click bookmark to expand for more info
(including a description/link to visit site), and also delete the bookmark.

Bookmarks are stored via the API so that upon refresh, the items are still present. This particular API wipes items every
24 hours.
